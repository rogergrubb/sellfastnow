# SellFast.Now - Project Status Summary

## Repository Restored
✅ Successfully cloned from: `https://github.com/rogergrubb/sellfastnow`

## Recent Work Completed (From Previous Session)

Based on the recovered chat content, you were working on implementing and fixing the **Credit Display System**:

### ✅ Completed Features:

1. **Credits Page** (`/credits`)
   - Shows available credits balance
   - Displays total purchased credits
   - Shows total used credits
   - Low credit warning (when < 10 credits)
   - Purchase options with all 5 credit bundles
   - "How It Works" educational section

2. **Navbar Credit Badge**
   - Sparkles icon + credit count display
   - Clickable badge linking to `/credits` page
   - Fetches from `/api/user/credits` endpoint
   - Real-time updates (refetches every 5 seconds)
   - **Mobile visibility**: Currently uses responsive classes `px-2 sm:px-3` and `text-xs sm:text-sm`
   - Badge is visible on all screen sizes (no `hidden md:flex` restriction)

3. **Backend API**
   - `/api/user/credits` endpoint exists and is functional (line 921 in backend)
   - Properly authenticated with Clerk tokens

### 🔍 Current State Analysis:

**Credit Badge Implementation** (Navbar.tsx, lines 136-146):
```tsx
<Badge 
  variant="secondary" 
  className="flex items-center gap-1 px-2 sm:px-3 cursor-pointer hover-elevate text-xs sm:text-sm"
  onClick={() => window.location.href = '/credits'}
  data-testid="badge-credits"
>
  <Sparkles className="h-3 w-3" />
  <span data-testid="text-credits-balance">
    {creditsLoading ? '...' : credits?.creditsRemaining ?? 0}
  </span>
</Badge>
```

**Status**: ✅ The credit badge is already configured to be visible on all devices. The last task from your previous session (making it visible on mobile) appears to have been completed.
