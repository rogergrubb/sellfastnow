## Adding Listings

There are two ways to add listings to your storefront: **individually** (one at a time) or via **bulk upload** (hundreds at once). This section covers individual listings; see the next section for bulk upload.

### Creating Individual Listings

#### Step 1: Navigate to Listings Tab

1. Go to your **Partner Dashboard**
2. Click the **Listings** tab
3. Click the **"Add New Listing"** button (or use Quick Actions on Overview tab)

#### Step 2: Fill Out Listing Details

Provide complete, accurate information for each item:

**Basic Information:**

| Field | Required | Best Practices |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Title** | Yes | Be specific and descriptive (e.g., "Herman Miller Aeron Office Chair - Size B") |
| **Description** | Yes | Include condition details, dimensions, materials, and any flaws |
| **Price** | Yes | Research comparable items; price competitively |
| **Category** | Yes | Choose the most accurate category for better searchability |
| **Condition** | Yes | Be honest: Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor |
| **Location** | Yes | City and state (e.g., "Seattle, WA") |

**Title Best Practices:**
- Include brand name if applicable
- Mention key features or model numbers
- Keep under 80 characters for optimal display
- Use title case (capitalize major words)

**Examples of Good Titles:**

- Specify if pickup only or delivery available

**Example Description:**

#### Step 3: Upload Photos

#### Step 4: Set Pricing

**Pricing Strategies:**

1. **Research Comparable Items**

2. **Factor in Your Costs**
   - Acquisition cost (if applicable)

   - Electronics: 30-60% depending on age

4. **Be Willing to Negotiate**

## Bulk Upload System

The bulk upload system allows you to add hundreds of listings at once using a CSV file and a ZIP file of images. This is ideal for estate sales, business liquidations, or large inventory updates.

### Overview

**Bulk Upload Process:**
1. Download CSV template
2. Fill out template with your inventory data
3. Prepare images and name them to match CSV
4. Upload CSV and ZIP file
5. Preview and validate items
6. Import all valid items at once

### Step 1: Download CSV Template

1. Go to **Partner Dashboard** → **Listings** tab
2. Click **"Bulk Upload CSV"** button
3. On the bulk upload page, click **"Download CSV Template"**
4. A file named `bulk-upload-template.csv` will download

### Step 3: Fill Out the CSV

**Best Practices:**

   - No dollar signs in prices: `350` not `$350`
   - Use lowercase for categories and conditions
   - Keep descriptions under 1000 characters

2. **Image File Naming**
   - List all image files for each item, separated by commas
   - Example: `"chair1.jpg,chair2.jpg,chair3.jpg"`
   - File names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - No spaces in filenames (use hyphens or underscores)

3. **Organize Your Data**
   - Group similar items together
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Double-check prices for accuracy
   - Proofread descriptions

**Example CSV Content:**
```csv

```

### Step 4: Prepare Your Images

**Image Organization:**

1. **Create a Folder** for all your product images
2. **Name Files** to match your CSV exactly
3. **Ensure Quality** – minimum 1200px, good lighting

**Naming Strategies:**

**Option A: Sequential Numbering**
```

lamp1.jpg, lamp2.jpg, lamp3.jpg
```

**Option B: SKU-Based**

2. Right-click → "Compress [number] Items"
3. Rename the resulting ZIP file

**Important:**

### Step 6: Upload Files

- You'll see the filename appear when uploaded

4. Click **"Process Files"** button

### Step 7: Preview & Validate

After processing, you'll see a preview screen showing:

**Summary Statistics:**
- **Total Items** – Number of rows in your CSV

- **Items with Errors** – Items that need fixing (red)

**Item List:**

### Bulk Upload Tips

**For Large Inventories (100+ items):**
- Break into batches of 50-100 items for easier management
- Test with a small batch first (5-10 items) to ensure format is correct
- Use spreadsheet formulas to auto-generate repetitive text
- Consider hiring a VA to help with data entry

**For Estate Sales:**
- Photograph all items in one session for consistent lighting
- Use room-based naming: `living-room-1.jpg`, `bedroom-1.jpg`
- Group items by room in your CSV for easier organization
- Include estate address in location field

**For Business Liquidations:**
- Export existing inventory from your system if possible
- Use SKU numbers for easy tracking

### Commission Structure

SellFast.Now uses a simple, transparent commission model:

**You Keep: 97%**  
**Platform Fee: 3%**

This is one of the lowest commission rates in the industry. For comparison:

| Platform | Commission | Your Net on $1000 Sale |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| **SellFast.Now** | 3% | $970 |
| eBay | 12.9% + $0.30 | $871 |
| Etsy | 6.5% + $0.20 | $935 |
| Amazon | 15% | $850 |
| Traditional Auction | 20-30% | $700-$800 |

### How Payments Work

**When a Customer Makes a Purchase:**

1. **Customer Pays** – Via credit card through Stripe
2. **Funds Held** – Stripe holds funds temporarily (standard practice)
3. **Payment Split** – Stripe automatically splits the payment:
   - **97%** goes to your Stripe account
   - **3%** goes to the platform
4. **Payout to Bank** – Funds transfer to your bank account based on your payout schedule

**Example Transaction:**
```
Sale Price:           $500.00
Platform Fee (3%):    -$15.00
Your Earnings:        $485.00
Stripe Processing:    -$14.50 (2.9% + $0.30)
Net to Your Bank:     $470.50
```

**Note:** Stripe's processing fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction) are separate from our platform fee and are deducted by Stripe before payout.

### Payout Schedule

**Default Schedule:** Weekly (every Friday)

**Payout Timing:**
- **Sale Date:** Monday
- **Payout Initiated:** Friday (4 days later)
- **Bank Deposit:** Tuesday (2 business days after payout)

**Changing Your Schedule:**
You can adjust your payout schedule in your Stripe dashboard:
- **Daily** – Payouts every business day (requires account history)
- **Weekly** – Every Friday (default)
- **Monthly** – First Friday of each month

### Viewing Your Earnings

### Tax Reporting

**1099-K Forms:**

**Record Keeping:**
We recommend:
- Download monthly transaction reports from Stripe
- Keep records of all expenses (acquisition costs, storage, etc.)
- Consult with a tax professional for deductions
- Track mileage for pickups and deliveries

**Sales Tax:**
Currently, sales tax collection is not automated. Consult with a tax professional to determine if you need to collect and remit sales tax in your state.
