## üîê SMS Integration Details

### **How It Works**

1. User clicks "Send Verification Code"
2. Backend generates 6-digit code
3. **If Twilio is configured**:
   - Sends SMS via Twilio REST API
   - Logs success with message SID
4. **If Twilio is NOT configured**:
   - Logs code to console
   - Shows warning about missing configuration
5. User receives code and verifies
6. Phone verification badge appears

### **Twilio Setup Instructions**

1. **Create Twilio Account**
   - Visit https://www.twilio.com/
   - Sign up for free trial or paid account
   - Get $15 free credit

2. **Get Credentials**
   - Go to Console Dashboard
   - Copy Account SID
   - Copy Auth Token
   - Get a phone number

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In Railway or your hosting platform
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+15551234567
   ```

4. **Test**
   - Deploy to Railway
   - Visit /verification
   - Try phone verification
   - Should receive real SMS!

### **Cost Estimate**

- **SMS Cost**: $0.0075 per message (US)
- **100 verifications**: $0.75
- **1,000 verifications**: $7.50
- **10,000 verifications**: $75.00

Very affordable for the trust and security benefits!
