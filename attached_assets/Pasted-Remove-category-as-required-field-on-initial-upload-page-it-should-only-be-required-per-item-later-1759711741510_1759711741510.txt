Remove category as required field on initial upload page - it should only be required per-item later:

LOGICAL PROBLEM:
- User uploads 3 items: a lamp (Home Decor), a phone (Electronics), a shirt (Clothing)
- Current flow asks for ONE category before upload → doesn't make sense for multi-category items
- "Continue to upload photos" button is disabled if category not selected
- This blocks the entire upload process

CORRECT FLOW:

1. INITIAL UPLOAD SCREEN:
   - User uploads photos (no category selection)
   - Remove category dropdown from this screen entirely
   - "Continue" button is ALWAYS active after photos uploaded
   - Don't ask for ANY details yet

2. AFTER AI ANALYSIS:
   - AI detects 3 different items
   - Each item gets its own form with its own category dropdown
   - Category required PER ITEM, not globally
   - Lamp → Category: Home Decor
   - Phone → Category: Electronics  
   - Shirt → Category: Clothing

3. UPDATE FORM STRUCTURE:

   BEFORE (current - WRONG):
[Upload Photos]
Category: [Select...] * Required ← BLOCKS multi-category uploads
[Continue] ← Disabled if no category

   AFTER (correct):
[Upload Photos]
[Continue] ← Always active
→ Then show individual item forms:
Item 1: [Lamp photo]
Category: [Home Decor] * ← Required here
Item 2: [Phone photo]
Category: [Electronics] * ← Required here
Item 3: [Shirt photo]
Category: [Clothing] * ← Required here

4. VALIDATION RULES:

   On upload screen:
   - Only require: At least 1 photo
   - NO category required
   - NO title/description required
   - "Continue" button enabled immediately after upload

   On item review screen (after AI analysis):
   - Each item requires: Title, Category, Price
   - Each item can have different category
   - Validate before final submission

5. CODE CHANGES NEEDED:

   Remove from initial upload page:
   - Category dropdown
   - Category validation
   - Any logic that disables "Continue" button based on category

   Add to individual item forms:
   - Category dropdown per item (with AI pre-selection)
   - Validation that checks each item has category
   - Default to "General" if user skips

6. USER FLOW:

   Step 1: Upload photos → Click Continue (no category needed)
   Step 2: AI analyzes and detects multiple items
   Step 3: Review each item, each has its own category dropdown
   Step 4: Submit all items (validate each has category)

This allows users to upload mixed-category items without being blocked.

Implement this flow change now and confirm when "Continue" button works without category selection.
