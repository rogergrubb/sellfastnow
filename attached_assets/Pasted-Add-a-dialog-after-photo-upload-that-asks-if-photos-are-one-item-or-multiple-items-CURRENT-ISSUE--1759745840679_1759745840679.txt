Add a dialog after photo upload that asks if photos are one item or multiple items:

CURRENT ISSUE:
When users upload 11 photos, the app treats them as 11 separate items by default. We need to ask first!

SOLUTION - Add Modal After Upload:

After photos are uploaded, show this dialog BEFORE the "Auto-Generate" button:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📸 How should we process these 11 photos?          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                     │
│  ○ One Item - Multiple Angles                      │
│    These photos show the SAME product from         │
│    different angles (e.g., 11 photos of a sofa)    │
│    → Creates 1 listing with 11 photos              │
│                                                     │
│  ○ Multiple Items - Different Products             │
│    Each photo is a DIFFERENT product               │
│    (e.g., 11 separate items to sell)               │
│    → Creates 11 separate listings                  │
│                                                     │
│             [Continue with AI Generation]           │

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Show this modal immediately after photos finish uploading
2. User must select one option to proceed
3. Store the choice in state: `isMultipleAngles` (boolean)
4. When "Auto-Generate" is clicked:
   - If "One Item - Multiple Angles": 
     * Use ALL photos for GPT-4 Vision analysis
     * Create ONE listing with all photos
     * Use 1 AI credit
   - If "Multiple Items":
     * Analyze each photo separately
     * Create separate listings
     * Use 11 AI credits

5. Show the credit cost in the modal:
   "This will use X AI credits"
   - One item = 1 credit
   - Multiple items = 11 credits

LOCATION: 
Place this modal in the post-ad page after the upload completes but before the "Auto-Generate Descriptions with AI" button becomes active.
This is essential because:

Saves credits - If it's one sofa from 11 angles, only use 1 credit!
Better UX - Users need control over how photos are grouped
Prevents mistakes - No accidentally creating 11 listings for 1 sofa
