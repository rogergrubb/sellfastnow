Fix category detection, add per-photo manual input, and improve countdown education:

PROBLEM 1: AUTOMOTIVE CATEGORY NOT POPULATING

Fix AI category detection:
- Ensure all categories are available: Electronics, Furniture, Clothing, Automotive, Books & Media, Sports, Home & Garden, Toys, Other
- Update OpenAI prompt to specifically recognize automotive items (cars, motorcycles, parts, accessories, tools)
- Test with car photos to verify "Automotive" category is detected
- Log which category AI selects for each item

PROBLEM 2: MANUAL INPUT NEEDS PER-PHOTO FIELDS

When user chooses "Skip AI, I'll write my own descriptions", show this layout:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
... (repeat for each photo)

Each photo gets its own complete form - NOT one batch form at bottom.

PROBLEM 3: EDUCATIONAL CONTENT DURING COUNTDOWN

Replace simple tips with detailed explanations that rotate during AI processing:

│  ✓ 3x more likely to sell within 7 days            │
│                                                    │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EDUCATIONAL MESSAGES (rotate every 8 seconds):

Message 1:
💡 How AI Tags Boost Your Sales
AI automatically generates meta tags from your photos - invisible
keywords that help buyers find your items. For example:
Photo of red Nike shoes → Tags: "athletic footwear", "running
shoes", "Nike brand", "red sneakers", "size 10"
Benefits:
✓ Your item appears in multiple searches
✓ Buyers searching "Nike" OR "running shoes" both find you
✓ Items with tags sell 40% faster
✓ No manual tagging needed - AI does it all

Message 2:
💡 SEO-Optimized Descriptions
AI writes descriptions using keywords buyers search for:
Instead of: "Nice chair for sale"
AI writes: "Ergonomic office chair with lumbar support,
adjustable height, mesh back - perfect for home office"
This means:
✓ Appears in searches for "office chair", "ergonomic", "lumbar"
✓ Detailed keywords increase click-through rate by 60%
✓ Professional descriptions build buyer trust
✓ Higher search ranking = more visibility

Message 3:
💡 Smart Category & Attribute Detection
AI doesn't just write text - it identifies product attributes:

Category (Automotive, Electronics, etc.)
Condition (New, Like New, Good, Fair)
Brand detection (Nike, Apple, IKEA)
Size, color, material specifications

Why this matters:
✓ Buyers can filter search by your exact attributes
✓ Appears in category-specific searches
✓ Accurate details reduce buyer questions
✓ Proper categorization = right audience sees your item

Message 4:
💡 Competitive Pricing Intelligence
AI analyzes similar items to suggest optimal pricing:

Scans recent sales of comparable products
Considers condition and features
Suggests retail price for context
Recommends competitive used price

Results:
✓ Price too high? AI prevents overpricing
✓ Price too low? AI helps you get fair value
✓ Properly priced items sell 2x faster
✓ Reduces back-and-forth negotiation

Message 5:
💡 Multi-Tag Strategy for Maximum Reach
One item gets tagged multiple ways to cast a wider net:
Example: Vintage leather jacket
Tags: "vintage clothing", "leather jacket", "men's outerwear",
"brown leather", "motorcycle jacket", "retro fashion"
Impact:
✓ 6 different search queries all find your item
✓ Reaches casual browsers AND specific searchers
✓ Items with 5+ tags get 3x more views
✓ Increases chance of appearing in "Related Items"

Message 6:
💡 Professional Presentation Advantage
AI-generated listings look professional because:

Proper grammar and spelling (builds trust)
Complete sentences (not rushed descriptions)
Highlights key features buyers care about
Includes measurements, materials, condition details

Statistics show:
✓ Professional listings get 50% more inquiries
✓ Buyers are willing to pay 15% more
✓ Lower chance of returns/disputes
✓ Faster sales with less negotiation

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Create array of 6 detailed educational messages
2. Rotate through them every 8-10 seconds during countdown
3. Always show progress bar, timer, and photo status above message
4. Make text readable (not too small, good contrast)
5. Use icons/emojis to break up text
6. Ensure messages fit on screen without scrolling

FIXES REQUIRED:

1. Add "Automotive" to category dropdown and AI detection
2. Create per-photo input forms for manual mode (not batch form)
3. Add detailed rotating educational content to countdown timer
4. Test automotive photo detection works properly

Confirm when all three issues are fixed.
