EDIT FORM STILL COMPLETELY BROKEN - Your fix did not work.

User clicks EDIT → Blank form appears with NO data, NO photos, NOTHING pre-filled.

This is the SAME bug reported multiple times. Stop saying it's fixed when it's not.

AGGRESSIVE DEBUGGING REQUIRED:

1. ADD CONSOLE LOGGING TO EDIT PAGE:

When edit page loads, log EVERYTHING:
```javascript
// In the edit form component
console.log('=== EDIT PAGE LOADED ===');
console.log('URL params:', window.location.search);
console.log('Listing ID from URL:', listingId);

// Before API call
console.log('Fetching listing data for ID:', listingId);

// After API call
fetch(`/api/listings/${listingId}`)
  .then(res => {
    console.log('API Response Status:', res.status);
    return res.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log('API Response Data:', data);
    console.log('Title:', data.title);
    console.log('Price:', data.price);
    console.log('Photos:', data.images);
    
    // After setting state
    console.log('Setting form fields...');
    setTitle(data.title);
    setPrice(data.price);
    // ... etc
    console.log('Form fields set!');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('FETCH FAILED:', err);
  });

CHECK NETWORK TAB:

Open browser DevTools → Network tab
Click EDIT on a listing
Look for: GET /api/listings/{id}

Is the request happening? YES/NO
What status code? (200, 404, 500?)
What does the response body contain?


CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE:

Open browser DevTools → Console tab
Click EDIT on a listing

Are there any errors?
Do you see the debug logs from step 1?
What values are being logged?


VERIFY THE API ENDPOINT EXISTS:

Test the endpoint directly in browser:

Navigate to: https://[your-replit-url]/api/listings/[any-listing-id]
Does it return the listing data?
If 404 or error, the endpoint is broken


CHECK IF LISTING ID IS VALID:

When user clicks EDIT, what URL do they see?

Should be: /post-ad?edit=clx123abc
If the ID is missing or wrong, that's the problem


POSSIBLE CAUSES:

Cause A: listingId not being extracted from URL

Check URL parsing logic
Verify query parameter is named correctly

Cause B: API endpoint not implemented

Verify GET /api/listings/:id exists
Check it returns data in correct format

Cause C: Data returned but not applied to form

Check if useEffect is running
Verify state setters are called
Check if form component unmounts/remounts

Cause D: Wrong listing ID being used

Verify EDIT button passes correct ID
Check URL has correct ID

DO THIS NOW:

Add all console.log statements from step 1
Click EDIT on a listing
Open browser console
Screenshot what you see in console
Screenshot Network tab showing the API request
Report back with screenshots

Stop claiming things are fixed without actually testing them. The form is STILL BLANK.
I need to see:

Console logs showing data fetch
Network tab showing successful API call
Proof that data exists but isn't displaying
Or proof that data fetch is failing

No more "should work" or "implemented" responses. Show me the actual debugging output.
