CRITICAL BUG: User cannot view their listings after creating them.

User creates listings successfully, but "My Listings" page doesn't show them.

COMPREHENSIVE DEBUG AND FIX:

1. VERIFY LISTINGS ARE SAVED TO DATABASE:
   After user creates listing, log to console:
   - "Listing saved to database with ID: [id]"
   - "User ID: [userId]"
   - Query database immediately: SELECT * FROM listings WHERE userId = '[current user id]'
   - Confirm listings exist in database

2. CHECK MY LISTINGS PAGE AUTHENTICATION:
   - Log user authentication status on /my-listings page
   - Log: "Authenticated user ID: [userId]"
   - If userId is null/undefined, authentication is broken
   - Ensure Clerk auth token is passed correctly to backend

3. VERIFY API ENDPOINT:
   GET /api/user/listings should:
   - Accept authenticated user's token
   - Extract userId from Clerk token
   - Query: SELECT * FROM listings WHERE userId = $1
   - Return ONLY that user's listings (not empty, not everyone's)
   - Log the SQL query being executed
   - Log how many listings are returned

4. CHECK FOR REDIRECTS:
   - Remove any code that redirects from /my-listings to home
   - Only redirect to login if user NOT authenticated
   - If authenticated, STAY on My Listings page

5. FRONTEND MY LISTINGS PAGE:
   - Log the API response data
   - If data is empty array [], show message: "You haven't created any listings yet"
   - If data has listings, render them
   - Don't redirect anywhere

6. ADD DETAILED ERROR LOGGING:
```javascript
   // In MyListings.tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     console.log('MyListings page mounted');
     console.log('User authenticated:', !!user);
     console.log('User ID:', user?.id);
     
     fetchMyListings()
       .then(data => {
         console.log('Received listings:', data);
         console.log('Number of listings:', data.length);
       })
       .catch(err => {
         console.error('Error fetching listings:', err);
       });
   }, []);

TEST COMPLETE FLOW:

User creates listing
Verify database INSERT successful
Click "My Listings" in navigation
Page should show the listing
No redirects to home


IF STILL NOT WORKING:

Add temporary test button that logs ALL listings in database
Compare with what My Listings page shows
Check if userId matching is the issue
Verify Clerk userId format matches database userId format



EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

User creates listing → Success
User clicks "My Listings" → Stays on page
Page loads user's listings from database
Listings display with EDIT buttons

Report exact error preventing listings from displaying and fix it permanently.
