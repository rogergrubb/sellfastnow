3. API ENDPOINT

POST /api/cancellations/:commentId/response

Request body:
{
  responseText: "Thanks for explaining! I understand...",
  isPublic: true
}

Backend logic:
1. Verify user is the OTHER party in the transaction
   - Get cancellation comment
   - Get transaction 
   - If comment.cancelled_by = buyer, verify current user = seller
   - If comment.cancelled_by = seller, verify current user = buyer
2. Check user hasn't already responded (one response per person)
3. Update cancellation_comments table:
   - response_by_user_id = current user
   - response_text = provided text
   - response_at = NOW()
4. Send email notification to original commenter
5. Return success

Security checks:
- 403 if user is not the other party
- 403 if user already responded
- 403 if transaction doesn't exist
- 400 if response text empty or > 500 chars

4. DISPLAY BOTH COMMENT AND RESPONSE

After response posted, display both in transaction history:

5. DISPLAY ON PUBLIC PROFILES

When viewing someone else's profile, show both sides:

On John's profile (the canceller):
Shows his comment AND the seller's response

On David's profile (the cancelled party):
Shows the buyer's comment AND his response

Both appear on both profiles for transparency.

6. EMAIL NOTIFICATION
