CRITICAL BUG: Purchase button redirects to blank/loading page instead of Stripe checkout

USER REPORT: Clicks "Purchase" → Page shows loading skeleton → Never reaches Stripe

DEBUG AND FIX:

1. Check what URL the purchase button redirects to:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
   - Click purchase button
   - Look at the navigation request
   - What URL is it trying to load?
   - Screenshot or log the URL

2. The page shows: /purchase-ai-credits route
   - This is WRONG - should redirect to Stripe, not internal page
   - Remove this intermediate page
   - Button should go DIRECTLY to Stripe checkout

3. Fix the purchase button code:
```javascript
const handlePurchase = () => {
  // Get Stripe payment link
  const stripeLink = process.env.STRIPE_AI_BATCH_LINK;
  
  console.log('Redirecting to Stripe:', stripeLink);
  
  if (!stripeLink) {
    alert('Payment system not configured. Please contact support.');
    return;
  }
  
  // Add user ID for tracking
  const url = `${stripeLink}?client_reference_id=${userId}&prefilled_email=${userEmail}`;
  
  // DIRECT redirect to Stripe (no intermediate page)
  window.location.href = url;
};

If STRIPE_AI_BATCH_LINK doesn't exist, create it NOW:

Using Stripe Create Payment Link tool:

Product name: "AI Credits - 25 Items"
Amount: $0.50 (for 1-2 items) OR $0.20 per item for 3+ items
Type: One-time payment
Success URL: https://[your-replit-url]/payment-success
Cancel URL: https://[your-replit-url]/post-ad

Save the link as STRIPE_AI_BATCH_LINK in Secrets.

Remove the /purchase-ai-credits page entirely:

It's unnecessary
Causes confusion
Button should skip directly to Stripe


Test the complete flow:

Click purchase button
Browser should immediately navigate to buy.stripe.com
Stripe checkout page should load
NOT stuck on loading page



EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
User clicks "Purchase" → Browser redirects to https://buy.stripe.com/test_xxxxx → Stripe checkout loads
ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
User clicks "Purchase" → Stuck on /purchase-ai-credits with gray skeleton
Fix the redirect NOW and test that Stripe checkout actually loads.
