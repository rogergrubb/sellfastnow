CRITICAL BUG - URGENT: User posted 30 items and NONE are visible in My Listings page.

This is the third time reporting this issue. It must be fixed NOW.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. CHECK DATABASE DIRECTLY:
   - Open database console
   - Run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM listings WHERE userId = '[Roger@grubb.net's Clerk ID]'
   - Are the 30 listings actually in the database? YES or NO?
   - If YES → problem is retrieval/display
   - If NO → problem is insertion/save

2. IF LISTINGS ARE IN DATABASE:
   Problem is My Listings page query or authentication.
   
   Debug the API endpoint:
   - GET /api/user/listings
   - Log the exact SQL query being executed
   - Log the userId being used in the WHERE clause
   - Log the results returned
   - Why is it returning empty when 30 listings exist?

3. IF LISTINGS ARE NOT IN DATABASE:
   Problem is submission process silently failing.
   
   Check submission logs:
   - Did 30 INSERT queries execute?
   - Were there any errors during insertion?
   - Is there a transaction rollback happening?
   - Are validation errors preventing saves?

4. MOST LIKELY CAUSES:
   - userId mismatch between Clerk and database
   - Authentication token not being passed to API
   - Silent database errors during bulk insert
   - My Listings page querying with wrong userId

5. FIX IT PERMANENTLY:
   Add comprehensive error handling:
```javascript
   // After listing creation
   const savedListing = await createListing(data);
   if (!savedListing || !savedListing.id) {
     throw new Error('Failed to save listing to database');
   }
   console.log('✓ Listing saved:', savedListing.id);
Add logging to My Listings:
javascript   const userId = await getCurrentUserId();
   console.log('Fetching listings for user:', userId);
   
   const listings = await fetchUserListings(userId);
   console.log('Found listings:', listings.length);
   
   if (listings.length === 0) {
     console.error('No listings found, but user may have created some');
     // Check database directly here
   }

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
Add a "View All Listings" button that shows:

All listings in database (admin view)
Filter by user email manually
At least let user see their 30 items somehow



User has now lost 30 listings. This is unacceptable.
Stop everything else and fix the My Listings page retrieval bug RIGHT NOW.
Report back with:

Are the 30 listings in the database?
What is preventing them from displaying?
The exact fix implemented

This is the top priority.

This is now a serious data loss issue that needs immediate resolution.
