CRITICAL BUG: AI upgrade payment button not functioning - no action when clicked.

User clicks "Complete All Items with AI - $X.XX" button → Nothing happens.

DEBUG THE BUTTON:

1. CHECK IF BUTTON HAS onClick HANDLER:
```javascript
   // Verify button has proper event handler
   <button 
     className="upgrade-button"
     onClick={handleAIUpgrade}  // ← Is this attached?
   >
     Complete All Items with AI - ${totalCost}
   </button>

ADD CONSOLE LOGGING:

javascript   const handleAIUpgrade = async () => {
     console.log('🔵 AI Upgrade button clicked!');
     console.log('Remaining items:', unpopulatedItems.length);
     console.log('Total cost:', cost);
     
     // Check if function executes
     alert('Button clicked - payment flow starting...');
     
     // Rest of payment logic...
   };

CHECK FOR JAVASCRIPT ERRORS:

Open browser console (F12)
Click the blue button
Look for any red error messages
Screenshot and report errors


VERIFY BUTTON IS NOT DISABLED:

javascript   // Make sure button isn't disabled
   <button 
     disabled={false}  // Should be false
     onClick={handleAIUpgrade}
   >

CHECK IF STRIPE/PAYMENT IS CONFIGURED:

Is Stripe initialized?
Are payment keys set in environment?
Is payment modal component created?


IMPLEMENT TEMPORARY TEST HANDLER:

javascript   const handleAIUpgrade = () => {
     // Temporary - just to test button works
     alert(`You clicked to purchase AI for ${remainingItems} items at $${totalCost}`);
     console.log('Payment would be processed here');
     
     // TODO: Add actual Stripe payment integration
   };

CHECK BUTTON RENDERING:

Is button actually visible on page?
Is it being rendered inside the component?
Check CSS - is it clickable or blocked by other elements?


VERIFY COMPONENT STATE:

javascript   console.log('Component mounted:', !!AIUpgradeSection);
   console.log('Remaining items state:', remainingItems);
   console.log('Button should be visible:', remainingItems > 0);
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
When button clicked → Show Stripe payment modal OR processing indicator OR at minimum a console log/alert
ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
Button click does nothing
IMMEDIATE FIX:
Add this temporary handler to verify button works at all:
javascript<button 
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('BUTTON CLICKED');
    alert('AI Upgrade clicked - Payment integration pending');
  }}
>
  Complete All Items with AI - ${totalCost}
</button>
Once button click is verified working, then add proper payment flow.
Report back:

Does console show "BUTTON CLICKED" when pressed?
