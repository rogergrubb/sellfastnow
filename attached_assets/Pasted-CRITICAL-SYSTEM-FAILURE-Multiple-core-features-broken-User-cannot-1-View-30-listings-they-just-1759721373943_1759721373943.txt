CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE - Multiple core features broken:

User cannot:
1. View 30 listings they just created
2. Edit any listings
3. Delete any listings

This marketplace is completely non-functional. Stop all other work and fix these three critical bugs NOW.

ISSUE 1: EDIT LISTING FAILURE

Debug edit functionality:
- What error is being thrown? Log the exact error message
- Is the edit endpoint working? Test: PUT /api/listings/:id
- Is authentication failing on edit requests?
- Are form values not saving to database?
- Add error logging to edit form submission

Fix requirements:
- User clicks EDIT button → Form opens with current values
- User changes values → Clicks SAVE
- Database updates successfully
- User sees success message
- Changes reflect immediately in My Listings

ISSUE 2: DELETE LISTING FAILURE

Debug delete functionality:
- What error is being thrown? Log the exact error message
- Is the delete endpoint working? Test: DELETE /api/listings/:id
- Is soft delete or hard delete failing?
- Are foreign key constraints preventing deletion?
- Add error logging to delete operation

Fix requirements:
- User clicks DELETE → Confirmation modal appears
- User confirms → Database removes/marks as deleted
- Listing disappears from My Listings immediately
- Success message shown

ISSUE 3: MY LISTINGS NOT DISPLAYING (ONGOING)

This is still not fixed despite multiple reports.

Add debug endpoint immediately:
```javascript
// GET /api/debug/my-listings
app.get('/api/debug/my-listings', async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.auth.userId;
  
  console.log('=== DEBUG MY LISTINGS ===');
  console.log('User ID from Clerk:', userId);
  
  // Check database directly
  const allListings = await db.query('SELECT id, title, userId FROM listings');
  console.log('Total listings in database:', allListings.length);
  
  const userListings = await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM listings WHERE userId = $1',
    [userId]
  );
  console.log('Listings for this user:', userListings.length);
  
  res.json({
    userId: userId,
    totalInDatabase: allListings.length,
    userListings: userListings.length,
    listings: userListings
  });
});
Call this endpoint and report:

User's Clerk ID
Total listings in database
How many belong to this user
Why they're not displaying

IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS:

Fix edit functionality within 30 minutes
Fix delete functionality within 30 minutes
Fix My Listings display within 30 minutes
Add comprehensive error logging to all three features
Test all three features and confirm working

NO MORE EXCUSES. NO MORE "IMPLEMENTING".
The user has created 30+ listings and cannot manage them at all. This is a complete system failure.
Report back with:

Exact errors causing edit failures
Exact errors causing delete failures
Exact reason My Listings is empty
Confirmation all three are fixed and tested

Priority: URGENT - Drop everything else.
