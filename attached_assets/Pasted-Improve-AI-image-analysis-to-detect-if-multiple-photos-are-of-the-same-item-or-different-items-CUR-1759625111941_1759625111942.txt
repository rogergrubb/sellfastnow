Improve AI image analysis to detect if multiple photos are of the same item or different items:

CURRENT ISSUE:
- AI only analyzes first image
- No logic to detect if 3 photos = 1 item (multiple angles) vs 3 items (separate products)

NEW SMART DETECTION LOGIC:

1. When user uploads multiple images, analyze ALL of them:
   - Send all image URLs to OpenAI in one request
   - Ask: "Are these photos showing the same product from different angles, or different products?"

2. OpenAI Vision prompt:
Analyze these images and determine:
A) SAME PRODUCT: All images show the same item from different angles/views
B) DIFFERENT PRODUCTS: Images show distinct, separate items
If SAME PRODUCT:

Provide ONE title, description, category, and price
Note: "Multiple angles of the same item detected"

If DIFFERENT PRODUCTS:

List each distinct product detected
For each product, specify which image number(s) show it
Provide separate title/description/category/price for each

Return JSON format:
{
"scenario": "same_product" | "multiple_products",
"products": [
{
"imageIndices": [0, 1, 2],
"title": "...",
"description": "...",
"category": "...",
"retailPrice": ...,
"usedPrice": ...,
"condition": "..."
}
]
}

3. UI Flow based on detection:

   **SCENARIO A: Same Product (3 photos of 1 phone)**
   - Auto-populate ONE listing form
   - Show message: "✓ Detected 3 photos of the same item"
   - Use all images for the single listing
   - Proceed normally

   **SCENARIO B: Different Products (phone, laptop, book)**
   - Show modal: "We detected 3 different items in your photos"
   - Options:
     □ "Create 3 separate listings" (auto-create each)
     □ "Let me choose which images go together" (manual grouping UI)
     □ "These are all the same item" (override AI, create 1 listing)
   
4. Multi-listing creation flow:
   - If user selects "Create separate listings"
   - Auto-create draft listings for each detected product
   - Show success: "Created 3 draft listings - review each before publishing"
   - Navigate to first draft for review

5. Error handling:
   - If AI can't determine, ask user: "Are these photos of the same item or different items?"
   - Always allow manual override

6. Also fix the 413 errors:
   - The "Request Entity Too Large" on /api/ai/analyze-photo
   - Increase request size limit or compress images before sending to AI
   - Server should handle larger image payloads

Implement this smart detection and confirm when ready to test.
