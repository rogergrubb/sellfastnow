CRITICAL BUG - EDIT FORM COMPLETELY BROKEN:

User clicks EDIT LISTING → Page shows BLANK FORM with NO data pre-filled.

This is destroying user data. Fix immediately.

BUGS TO FIX:

1. EDIT FORM NOT LOADING EXISTING DATA:
   - When user clicks EDIT, form appears empty
   - Title, description, price, category, photos - ALL BLANK
   - Form should be PRE-FILLED with existing listing data
   
   Fix:
   - Fetch listing data by ID when edit page loads
   - Populate all form fields with existing values
   - Show existing photos in the form
   - User should see current data, not blank fields

2. SAVING WIPES OUT ALL DATA EXCEPT CHANGED FIELD:
   - User changes only price: $100 → $150
   - Clicks SAVE
   - Result: Title gone, description gone, photos gone, only price remains
   - This is data loss
   
   Fix:
   - PATCH request should only update changed fields
   - Keep all existing data that wasn't modified
   - Don't set fields to null/empty if they weren't edited
   
   Correct update logic:
```javascript
   // WRONG (current):
   UPDATE listings SET 
     title = $1,        // NULL if not in form
     description = $2,  // NULL if not in form
     price = $3,        // Only this has value
     imageUrl = $4      // NULL - photo lost!
   WHERE id = $5
   
   // CORRECT:
   UPDATE listings SET 
     price = $1  // Only update what changed
   WHERE id = $2
   // Keep everything else unchanged

PHOTOS DELETED WHEN MODIFYING PRICE:

Photos should NEVER be deleted unless user explicitly removes them
Editing price should not touch photos at all
Photo URLs must persist in database

Fix:

Don't include imageUrl in UPDATE query unless user changed photos
If photos unchanged, don't update that field
Only update photos if user uploaded new ones or deleted existing



COMPREHENSIVE TESTING REQUIRED:
Test EVERY function in the dashboard by actually clicking through the UI:
TEST 1: VIEW LISTINGS

 Navigate to My Listings
 Verify all 30 user listings appear
 Each listing shows: photo, title, price, edit button, delete button

TEST 2: EDIT LISTING (NO CHANGES)

 Click EDIT on any listing
 Verify form pre-fills with: title, description, category, price, condition, photos
 Click CANCEL
 Verify listing unchanged

TEST 3: EDIT PRICE ONLY

 Click EDIT on a listing
 Change price from $100 to $150
 Click SAVE
 Verify: Price updated to $150
 Verify: Title still there
 Verify: Description still there
 Verify: Photos still there
 Verify: Category still correct

TEST 4: EDIT DESCRIPTION ONLY

 Click EDIT on a listing
 Change description text
 Click SAVE
 Verify: Description updated
 Verify: Price unchanged
 Verify: Photos unchanged
 Verify: Title unchanged

TEST 5: EDIT PHOTOS ONLY

 Click EDIT on a listing
 Remove one photo
 Add one new photo
 Click SAVE
 Verify: Photos updated correctly
 Verify: All text fields unchanged
 Verify: Price unchanged

TEST 6: DELETE LISTING

 Click DELETE on a listing
 Confirm deletion in modal
 Verify: Listing removed from My Listings
 Verify: Listing removed from database
 Verify: Other listings unaffected

TEST 7: EDIT MULTIPLE FIELDS

 Click EDIT on a listing
 Change title, price, and description
 Click SAVE
 Verify: All three fields updated
 Verify: Photos still there
 Verify: Category unchanged

RECORD A VIDEO of you performing all 7 tests showing they work correctly.
CODE FIX EXAMPLE:
Edit form should load like this:
javascript// EditListing.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch existing listing data
  fetch(`/api/listings/${listingId}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(listing => {
      // Pre-fill form with existing data
      setTitle(listing.title);
      setDescription(listing.description);
      setPrice(listing.price);
      setCategory(listing.category);
      setCondition(listing.condition);
      setImages(listing.images);
      console.log('✓ Form pre-filled with:', listing);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error('Failed to load listing:', err);
      alert('Error loading listing data');
    });
}, [listingId]);
Save should work like this:
javascript// Only update fields that changed
const handleSave = async () => {
  const updates = {};
  
  if (title !== originalTitle) updates.title = title;
  if (price !== originalPrice) updates.price = price;
  if (description !== originalDescription) updates.description = description;
  // Only include changed fields in update
  
  await fetch(`/api/listings/${listingId}`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    body: JSON.stringify(updates)
  });
};
DO NOT MARK THIS TASK COMPLETE UNTIL:

Edit form pre-fills all existing data
Saving only updates changed fields
Photos never disappear when editing other fields
All 7 tests pass

This is your top priority. Nothing else matters until CRUD operations work.
