    - "Create Bundle Listing" - AI-generated multi-item bundle with combined title, description, and smart pricing
    - "These Are All the Same Item" - Treat all photos as the same product
  - **Multi-Item Bundle Generation:** When "Create Bundle Listing" is selected:
    - AI automatically generates a cohesive bundle title (e.g., "3-Item Bundle: Kitchen Faucet, Elliptical Trainer, Sun Hat")
    - Creates structured description listing all items with key details and total retail value
    - Calculates intelligent bundle pricing (20-40% below total retail value for bundle savings)
    - Auto-fills listing form with bundle data (title, description, category, price)
    - Shows informative message with item count and total retail value
  - POST /api/ai/analyze-photo endpoint uses GPT-5 with vision capabilities for product identification.
  - POST /api/ai/analyze-multiple-images endpoint for multi-product detection with parallel processing.
  - POST /api/ai/generate-bundle-summary endpoint creates multi-item bundle listings with GPT-5.
- **Intelligent Listing Creation (AI-Powered Coaching):** Streamlined listing creation experience with AI assistance:
  - **Description Coaching:** Strength meter (0-10) analyzes descriptions and identifies missing information. AI-generated enhanced descriptions available with one click. Suggestions include adding measurements, materials, condition details, and purchase history.
