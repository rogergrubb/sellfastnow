**Commit**: `692da8f`  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Deployed to GitHub

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Stripe System Improvements

1. **✅ Eliminated Duplicate Stripe Client**
   - Removed two separate Stripe instantiations
   - Created single centralized client in `server/stripe.ts`
   - Reduced memory usage and improved maintainability

2. **✅ Centralized Configuration**
   - Created `server/config/stripe.config.ts`
   - Moved credit bundles, platform fee, and other settings to config
   - Easy to update pricing without touching route code

3. **✅ Environment Variable Validation**
   - Added startup validation for required Stripe env vars
   - Application will fail fast if `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` or `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is missing
   - Clear error messages for configuration issues

4. **✅ Rate Limiting**
   - Added rate limiting to payment intent creation (10/minute)
   - Added rate limiting to checkout sessions (20/minute)
   - Added rate limiting to Stripe Connect account creation (5/hour)
   - Prevents abuse and reduces API costs

5. **✅ Idempotency Keys**
   - Added idempotency keys to payment intent creation
   - Added idempotency keys to checkout session creation
   - Prevents duplicate charges on retry/refresh

6. **✅ Dynamic Base URL**
   - Replaced hardcoded URLs with `getBaseUrl()` function
   - Supports `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
   - Better support for custom domains

### Messaging System Improvements

1. **✅ Comprehensive Message Validation**
   - Content length validation (1-5000 characters)
   - Spam pattern detection (repeated characters, too many URLs)
   - Participant verification (receiver must exist)
   - Self-messaging prevention
   - Listing context validation

2. **✅ Rate Limiting**
   - Limited to 20 messages per minute per user
   - Prevents spam and abuse
   - Clear error messages when rate limit exceeded

3. **✅ Pagination**
   - Added pagination to `/api/messages` endpoint
   - Default: 50 messages per page
   - Supports `?page=1&limit=50` query parameters
   - Returns pagination metadata (total, totalPages, etc.)

4. **✅ Content Trimming**
   - Automatically trims whitespace from messages
   - Prevents empty messages with just spaces

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Stripe System Tests

- [ ] **Credit Purchase Flow**
  1. Go to credits page
  2. Select a credit bundle
  3. Complete checkout
  4. Verify credits are added after payment

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  1. Try creating 11 payment intents in 1 minute
  2. Should see rate limit error on 11th attempt

- [ ] **Idempotency**
  1. Create checkout session
  2. Refresh page immediately
  3. Should not create duplicate session

- [ ] **Stripe Connect**
  1. Create Stripe Connect account
  2. Try creating 6 accounts in 1 hour
  3. Should see rate limit on 6th attempt

### Messaging System Tests

- [ ] **Valid Message**
  1. Send a normal message
  2. Should succeed

- [ ] **Empty Message**
  1. Try sending empty message
  2. Should fail with "Message cannot be empty"

- [ ] **Long Message**
  1. Try sending 5001+ character message
  2. Should fail with "Message is too long"

- [ ] **Self-Messaging**
  1. Try sending message to yourself
  2. Should fail with "You cannot send a message to yourself"

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  1. Send 21 messages in 1 minute
  2. Should see rate limit error on 21st message

- [ ] **Pagination**
  1. Go to `/api/messages?page=1&limit=10`
  2. Should return 10 messages with pagination metadata

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Memory Usage
- **Before**: 2 Stripe client instances
- **After**: 1 Stripe client instance
- **Savings**: ~50% reduction in Stripe client memory

### API Efficiency
- **Before**: No rate limiting (potential for abuse)
- **After**: Rate limits protect against abuse
- **Result**: Lower API costs, better reliability

### Database Performance
- **Before**: Fetched all messages (no pagination)
- **After**: Paginated queries (50 per page)
- **Result**: Faster queries, less memory usage

## 🔍 Monitoring Recommendations

### Railway Logs to Watch

1. **Startup Logs**
   - Look for: `✅ Stripe client initialized successfully`
   - If missing: Check `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` env var

2. **Rate Limit Logs**
   - Watch for: `Too many requests` errors
   - If frequent: May need to adjust limits

3. **Message Validation Logs**
   - Look for: `❌ Message validation failed`
   - Indicates spam attempts or user errors

4. **Stripe Webhook Logs**
   - Watch for: `✅ Created checkout session`
   - Verify credits are being added after payment

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing required Stripe environment variables"
**Solution**: Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Railway

### Issue: Rate limit errors immediately after deployment
**Solution**: Rate limiters reset on deployment. Wait a few minutes.

### Issue: Messages endpoint returns different format
**Solution**: Frontend may need updates to handle pagination. Old format: `[messages]`, New format: `{ messages: [...], pagination: {...} }`

### Issue: Stripe webhooks not working
**Solution**: 
1. Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
2. Verify webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe-webhook`
3. Check Railway logs for webhook errors
